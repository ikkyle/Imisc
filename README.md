Imisc
=====
A bunch of functions for doing useful things. 

* `unknownToNA` and `trim` were copied verbatim from the `gdata` package.
* `plot_effects` is an ever so slightly "improved" version of `plot.eff` from the `effects` package. 
* `number2words` was copied verbatim from John Fox's function in some issue of the R journal.
* `paste_ws` was copied from a stack overflow post and reworked a bit (and renamed to sound a bit more like the MySQL function `CONCAT_WS`)

cool beans.
