A bunch of functions for doing things. 

* `unknownToNA` and `trim` were copied verbatim from the `gdata` package.
* `plot_effects` is an ever so slightly "improved" version of `plot.eff` from the `effects` package. 
* `number2words` was copied verbatim from John Fox's function in some issue of the R journal.
* `paste_ws` was copied from a stack overflow post and reworked a bit (and renamed to sound a bit more like the MySQL function `CONCAT_WS`)
* The idea behind `obfus` was pulled from the help page for `chartr`. It is useful if you have a password in a script. People behind you won't immediatly see your password

I might document things eventually. I might not. In the meantime, go have a beer. Cheers.
